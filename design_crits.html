							<h1>Design Critiques</h1>

							<div class="MuiBox-root css-m507i9">
								<p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-lj8hfv">

								</p>
							</div>

							<p>After producing our high-fidelity prototype, we wanted to observe how our student
								colleagues would perform a set of tasks using
								our prototype. Specifically, we aimed to identify any questions, issues, or concerns
								they had with our design. Below are the scenarios and tasks we presented to our
								colleagues during the high-fidelity design critique session, followed by key feedback
								and a discussion on how it will influence our future design iterations.
							</p>

							<h2>Scenario 1</h2>

							<p>As a Big Horn county community leader, you want to create a visualization for community
								size over the last 11 years to share with fellow county administrators. You decide to
								use the ITRRâ€™s dashboards of Montana resident attitude data Located on their site.</p>
							<h4>Tasks:</h4>
							<ol>
								<li> Navigate to the Resident Attitude Data dashboard.</li>
								<li> Select County </li>
								<li> Share and Export Data Visual and Overview Report for community size.</li>
							</ol>
							<br>

							<h2>Scenario 2</h2>

							<p>An ITRR team member is collecting data to analyze and prepare a presentation for their
								leadership to express resident attitude data across the counties involved in the Pilot
								Community Grant Program. Deer Lodge(Anaconda) - Sweet Grass(Big Timber) - Powder
								River(Broadus)</p>
							<h4>Tasks:</h4>
							<ol>
								<li> Navigate to the Resident Attitude Data dashboard.</li>
								<li> Select County from Pilot Community Grant Program.</li>
								<li> Create an infographic of selected resident attitude data.</li>
							</ol>
							<br>

							<h2>Scenario 3</h2>

							<p>A Community Leader who is color blind wants to do some research on Mineral County and
								compare it to data gathered from Missoula County. They are looking to see where there
								are similarities and differences between small towns and large cities regarding State
								and Community Overcrowding.</p>
							<h4>Tasks:</h4>
							<ol>
								<li> Navigate to the Resident Attitude Data dashboard.</li>
								<li> Select Mineral County.</li>
								<li> Select Comparison.</li>
								<li> Select Data Options.</li>
								<li> Change the color scheme.</li>
								<li> Export the graphs.</li>
								<li> Navigate back to the main page. </li>
							</ol>
							<br>

							<h2>Scenario 4</h2>

							<p>A data visualization student is performing research based on their local community and
								looking for aesthetically pleasing visual graphs. They found the website through umt.edu
								webpage and investigate the following communties: Hill County(Havre) - Lake
								County(Ronan) - Garfield(Garfield) - Glacier county (Blackfeet Group)</p>

							<h4>Tasks:</h4>
							<ol>
								<li> Navigate to the Resident Attitude Data dashboard.</li>
								<li> Select County.</li>
								<li> Look through graphs.</li>
								<li> Export the most interesting graph.</li>
								<li> Navigate to the homepage and repeat until satisfied.</li>
							</ol>


							<h2>Summary of feedback from in-class Design Crits</h2>

							<p>Below is a list of the most common feedback we received during our design crit session
								using our high-fidelity prototype. </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Share/Export and download buttons need to be labelled clearly, there was an
									abundance of confusion during all critiques.</li>
								<li>Font needs to be larger, it was difficult to read at times.</li>
								<li>Labels need to be clearer, the site was not as intuitive as we had initially
									believed.</li>
								<li>Color scheme and functionality overall was a success, most users enjoyed using the
									dashboard and gave positive feedback on aesthetics.</li>
							</ul>

							To illustrate how this feedback will impact future iterations of our design, we include a
							couple of annotated screen shots illustrating the problem, alongside a description of how we
							plan to resolve that particular issue going forward.
